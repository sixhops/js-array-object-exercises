var colors = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "pink", "black", "gray", "blue", "violet"];

// The array above contains all the colors in the visible light spectrum but has some
// that don't belong. In case you've forgotten, the colors in the spectrum are:
//  red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet

// Write a script that removes the incorrect colors from the Array using built-in
// Array functions.
