// You have two arrays above of people who arrived late to your party and
// people who arrived early. Please create a new array that holds all of
// the party attendees and make sure they appear in the order of arrival,
// meaning no late comer should appear in the array before an early bird.

// Solve this using one of the built-in Array functions first. Then, rewrite
// it using the newer Array spread operator.
