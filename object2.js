var myKey = 'width';

var geometry = {
  length: 20,
  width: 30,
  height: 10,
  weight: 100
};

// There is an object above and a variable holding a key name. Use that variable
// to access and print the "width" value inside the object. Add another line that uses the
// same style access syntax to print the length as well but uses a string literal
// instead of a variable holding a string.
